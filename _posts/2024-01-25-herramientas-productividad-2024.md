## Why Shoe Size Conversion Matters

When buying shoes online, a wrong size doesn‚Äôt just mean disappointment. It can lead to:
- üõçÔ∏è Extra shipping costs for returns  
- ‚è≥ Weeks of waiting for replacements  
- üòû Frustration when the right size is sold out  

Different brands often have their own sizing standards. For example:
- **Nike** tends to run smaller compared to other sports brands.  
- **Adidas** fits slightly wider, making them a better choice for broader feet.  
- **Puma** usually follows EU sizing closely, but varies in US and UK equivalents.
