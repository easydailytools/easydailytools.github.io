## Why Shoe Size Conversion Matters

When buying shoes online, a wrong size doesn't just mean disappointment. It can lead to:

- 🛍️ **Extra shipping costs** for returns  
- ⏳ **Weeks of waiting** for replacements  
- 😞 **Frustration** when the right size is sold out  

Different brands often have their own sizing standards. For example:
