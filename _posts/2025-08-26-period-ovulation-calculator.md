##  How to Use It Effectively

1. **Input Your Period Start Date** — led by instinct, not guesswork.  
2. **Adjust Your Cycle Length (21-35 Days)** and **Luteal Phase (10-16 Days)** if needed.  
3. **Tap ‘Calculate’**—your upcoming fertile days and cycle map appear instantly.  
4. **Plan Accordingly**—track with confidence whether you're trying to conceive or just stay informed.

##  Real-Life Scenarios

- **Trying to conceive?** Knowing the 7-day fertile window can significantly improve your chances.  
- **Curious about cycle trends?** Track phases over several months to understand your body's rhythm.  
- **Privacy-conscious?** This tool respects your data—no tracking, no sign-up, no sharing.

##  Quick Tips for Better Accuracy

- Stick to a few regular cycles to enhance prediction precision (around **95% accurate** for regular cycles).  
- For irregular cycles, use the tool regularly to adjust and improve phase predictions.  
- Remember: this is a tracking aid—not a birth control method. For contraception advice, consult a healthcare professional.
