# Nike Kids Shoe Size Guide & Converter: Find the Perfect Fit for Your Child

Buying the right pair of shoes for your child can be surprisingly tricky. Every brand has its own sizing rules, and when you add international conversionsâ€”US, UK, EU, and CM (foot length)â€”things get even more confusing. If you are shopping for **Nike kidsâ€™ shoes**, youâ€™ll want to make sure you get the right size the first time to avoid returns and keep your child comfortable.  

Thatâ€™s where our **[Nike Kids Shoe Size Converter](https://www.easydailytools.com/en/nike-kids-shoe-size-converter)** comes in.

## Why Nike Kids Sizes Can Be Confusing

- **Different regions, different charts**: A Nike US size 3Y doesnâ€™t directly match a UK 3 or EU 35.  
- **Youth vs. toddler sizing**: Nike uses terms like **TD (Toddler)**, **PS (Preschool)**, and **GS (Grade School)**, which can be unclear.  
- **Foot growth speed**: Childrenâ€™s feet grow quickly, so buying the wrong size can mean outgrowing shoes even faster.

## Nike Kids Size Categories

Nike typically divides childrenâ€™s shoes into:  

- **Infant/Toddler (0C â€“ 10C)** â†’ For babies and toddlers.  
- **Preschool (10.5C â€“ 3Y)** â†’ For younger children.  
- **Grade School (3.5Y â€“ 7Y)** â†’ For older kids and early teens.  

Each range has slightly different fit standards.
